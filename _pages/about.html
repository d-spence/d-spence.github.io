    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h4>Thanks for stopping by! My name's Dan.</h4>
    <p>I'm a determined, focused individual with a passion for learning and computer programming.
        While my primary interest is web-development, I also enjoy studying the broader concepts of software engineering and computer science.
        My current ambition is to work as a full-stack web developer and continue to refine and enhance my skillset.

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>From an early age, computers have fascinated me. Initially through PC games, later with software and operating systems and eventually with programming. 
        In 2012 I started coding with Python, and continued to learn over the years. In 2020 I decided to focus my efforts on learning full-stack web development.
        My experience with Python has been a great help in the transition to JavaScript and allows a little more flexibility with the frameworks I use.
