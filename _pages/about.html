<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Thanks for visiting! My name's Dan and this is my very own website. I was born in Southern California, but
    now reside in the great state of Texas, not too far from Austin. I'm currently trying to establish myself as a 
    front-end developer and this website serves as part of the learning process. 
    It also houses my personal <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> and <a href="/blog">blog</a> so feel free to check 
    those out if you're into that sorta thing.
</p>
<p>I'm constantly looking to learn more about computer science, software development and technology. I started learning 
    Python (v2.7) back in 2012, but was more of a hobbist programmer until recently (c.2020). I've work with computers 
    for most of my life so I like to think I have a good understanding of them. Still, there is much I don't know and I 
    enjoy the process of learning.
