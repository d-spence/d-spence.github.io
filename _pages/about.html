    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h4>Thanks for stopping by! My name's Dan.</h4>
    <p>I'm a determined, hard-working individual with a passion for learning, whether it's by success, error or simply reading the documentation. 
        My current goal is to establish a career as a front-end web developer. I am looking to be apart of an organization where I can contribute
        as well as advance my knowledge and skills by working alongside knowledgeable people. 
        My long-term career ambition is achieving mastery in the field of web development.
    </p><br>
    <p>Still, I recognize that the learning process is never truly finished and I'm continually seeking to further my understanding and application of 
        software development, web technology, and computer science.
        This website is part of the learning process and also home to my personal <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> and <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
        Or, if you'd like to get in touch, head over <a href="/contact">here</a> and send me a message!

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>From an early age, computers have interested me. Initially with PC games and later with software and operating systems. 
        When I eventually started learning programming with Python (v2.7) back in 2012, I began to see the true potential and creativity possible.
        Over the years I grew in my computer understanding, but was more or less a hobbyist in regards to coding.
    </p><br>
    <p>In 2020 I decided to switch gears and focus on aquiring an employable web developer skillset. Though the pandemic has been a trying time,
        it has also provided me the opportunity to study something that I enjoy and find rewarding, despite the challenges and frustration at times.
